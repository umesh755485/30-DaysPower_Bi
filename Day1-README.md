        5. First Launch:-
        
            * On first launch, you will see the Welcome screen, where you can start importing data, open recent reports, or explore     tutorials.
            
        * Additional Notes:-
        
            * Power BI Desktop is available in both Microsoft Store and direct download versions; do not install both on the same machine to avoid conflicts.
            
            * For advanced users or administrators, command-line installation options are available for silent or customized installs.
            
            * Ensure your system meets minimum requirements: Windows 10 or later, and Internet Explorer 9 or higher

ðŸŒŸ Topics Covered:-

1. Import Mode vs. Direct Query Mode
    * Import Mode
        * Data is imported and stored in Power BI.
        * Enables fast performance and offline analysis.
        * If your data is less than 1GB then we will use import mode 
    
    * Direct Query Mode
        * Data remains in the source (e.g., SQL Server).
        * Queries are run live, ensuring real-time data.
        * May be slower depending on source performance.


    * Key Differences
        * Import Mode: Best for smaller datasets and faster report interaction.
        * Direct Query: Suitable for large datasets or when real-time data is needed.

<br>

2. Appending Data:-
    * Combined data from multiple tables or sources using the Append Queries feature in Power Query Editor.
    * Useful for merging datasets with similar structures (e.g., monthly sales files).

<br>

3. Importing Data from SQL Server:-
    * Connected Power BI to a SQL Server database.
    * Selected tables or wrote SQL queries to import specific data.
    * Practiced both Import and Direct Query connection options.

<br>

4. Importing Data from Excel:-
    * Imported data from Excel files.
    * Selected specific sheets or named ranges.
    * Understood the importance of data formatting in Excel for smooth import.

<br>

âœ… Key Takeaways:-

        * Gained hands-on experience with Power BIâ€™s data connectivity options.
        * Understood when to use Import Mode vs. Direct Query Mode.
        * Practiced appending data from multiple sources for unified analysis.
        * Successfully imported data from both SQL Server and Excel for use in Power BI reports.

 <br>

 ðŸš€ Next Steps:-
 
        * Explore data transformation and cleaning techniques in Power Query.
        * Practice merging data from different sources.
        * Start building simple visualizations and dashboards.
