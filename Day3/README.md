<h2>1. Introduction to Page Formatting</h2>

  Page formatting in Power BI refers to customizing the appearance and layout of your report pages. This involves:

  * Setting the canvas size and orientation
  * Adjusting background colors or images
  * Aligning the report page within the viewing area
  * Customizing the filter pane and cards
  * Applying consistent themes and templates
## Thoughtful page formatting enhances readability, reinforces branding, and improves the overall user experience

<h2>2. Setting Up Your Report Page</h2>

  a. Creating and Naming Pages
  * When you open Power BI Desktop, you start with a blank canvas (default 16:9 ratio).
  * Add new pages using the "+" button at the bottom.
  * Rename pages for clarity by double-clicking or right-clicking the page name.

  b. Page Information Settings
  * Assign meaningful names to pages for easy navigation.
  * Enable the page as a tooltip if you want it to provide additional context when users hover over data points in other visuals.
  * Allow the page for Q&A if you want it included in Power BI’s natural language Q&A feature

 <h2>3. Canvas Settings Customization</h2>

   * Power BI offers several page size presets:
     
      | Page Size | Description                                         |
      |-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
      | 16:9      | Default, best for dashboards on screens             |
      | 4:3       | Suited for legacy presentations or embedded reports |
      | Letter    | Portrait orientation, ideal for PDF/print           |
      | Tooltip   | Small, square, used for custom tooltips             |
      | Custom    | Set your own dimensions (pixels)                    |
    Choose the size that fits your report’s purpose and target device
